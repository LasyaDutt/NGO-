# NGO - Charity Website 
Description:
The NGO Charity was founded to connect people who wish to serve their communities,  We want to make it easy for users to become blood donors or volunteer for local food distributions and other charities.
When the user visits NGO Charity website, they are asked whether they want to participate by contributing money, food, and blood, or offering their valuable time.
